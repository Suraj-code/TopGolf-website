# TREETOP GOLF

This is a scoring system for tree top mini golf and is mainly intended for users that enjoy indoor golf.

How this system works is you are presented with rules, you are then asked to enter your names and start which will bring up score tables for users to enter their scores. At the end on the click of a button the users will be presented their individual scores. As this is a system that will mostly be used when the users are at the golf venue, it is fully functional for a mobile device which will be used majority of the time. However, it is made responsive for other devices with larger screens. For example the tables in a larger screen will be presented all side by side rather than just one. Font sizes have also been adjusted according to different screen sizes as well as the nav bar is displayed at the top with bigger screen sizes.

## Playing again/Reloading page
 After, the scores are shown and the user goes back to the scores page to play again, they will need to reload the page before entering the names again, to restore everything back to starting state, otherwise the previous scores will be displayed.
